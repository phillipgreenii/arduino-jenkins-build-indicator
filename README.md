This is a simple project that will show the current status of a
jenkins build via RGB Led.  Red means broken, green means success, and
pulsating yellow means the build is currently being built.  Additionally,
a small song will be played as the build transitions from pass to fail or vice
versa.  The project has only been tested on windows, but supports dynamically
plugging in and pulling out an arduino device.
